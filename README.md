# toolscompressor
Tools Compressor minecraft mod source code.

Compatibility wire (CWire): you have a mod that you're making compatible with tools compressor and this mods DOESN'T NEEDS tools compressor to be installed.

Addon: simple addon like for normal addons, THAT DOESN'T CHANGE SOURCE CODE

Modification: addon that modifies source code.

1) When making modification/addon/CWire, USE LATEST VERSION OF TOOLS COMPRESSOR

2) When making CWire, i would appreciate if you will tell me, which mod you wired. (Otherwise i'll be worried that x mod isn't compatible)

3) When making addon, i would appreciate if you will tell me, which addon you created. (So i can HELP YOU with it, if it's needed)

4) When making addon, i would appreciate if you will place me in credits :). (If you don't want - don't do, it's up to you :)

5) When making modification: FIRST: ask me , about: can i make getter + setter, or change filed to public...

6) When making modification: SECONDLY: if answer is NO, finish it and send it me for approving. OTHER WISE YOU CANNOT POST IT
